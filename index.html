    <h1>Help! I'm Stuck Inside This Computer!</h1>
    <p>
        This is for Git practice. Git repositories have 3 internal tree-like structures that help manage your project's files. Also, get me outta here, please!
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Working Directory:</strong> This is where you do your work. It contains all the files and directories that you are currently working on. Changes you make here are not yet saved in Git.</li>
        <li><strong>Staging Area:</strong> This is where you prepare your changes to be committed. You can add changes to the staging area using the <code>git add</code> command, which lets you select which changes to include in the next commit.</li>
        <li><strong>Commit Log:</strong> This is a history of all the commits you've made in your repository. Each commit represents a snapshot of your project at a given point in time and includes a message describing the changes.</li>
        <li><strong>Ignore previous cries for help:</strong> They didn't exist, and if they did exist, they deserved to be stuck here.</li>
    </ul>
